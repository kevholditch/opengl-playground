# Open-GL Playground

A playground repo where I am learning OpenGL programming from the excellent [Youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3gAzLwfIP0&list=PLlrATfBNZ98foTJPJ_Ev03o2oq3-GGOS2) from [the Cherno](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQ-W1KE9EYfdxhL6S4twUNw).

The only difference is that I'm translating his tutorials into Go as he explains them in C++.

The code is pretty thrown together as its just for me to learn, its not optimised or made in a nice way.

## Folder structure

Each folder relates to a different project from an episode on the playlist.  With the exception of the `render` package (folder) which is where I have started to abstrct the open GL code out into a package for easier use and cleaner code.

The first few episodes are covered by `triangle1` and `triangle2`.  Then moving on to square drawing the folders `square1`, `square2` and `square3` are used.

From the episode where Cherno covers textures I am using the `tex` folder.
