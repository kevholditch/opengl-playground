# Open-GL Playground

A playground repo where I am learning OpenGL programming from the excellent [Youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3gAzLwfIP0&list=PLlrATfBNZ98foTJPJ_Ev03o2oq3-GGOS2) from [the Cherno](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQ-W1KE9EYfdxhL6S4twUNw).

The only difference is that I'm translating his tutorials into Go as he explains them in C++.

The code is pretty thrown together as its just for me to learn, its not optimised or made in a nice way.
